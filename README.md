# Voy's PoligonVR Avatar Menu Editor
I made this because I was making an Avatar Menu for PVR and the Default Menu Editor sucked to work with in my opinion.
## What does this do?
Custom Editor Window in Unity that allows you to Edit a PVR Avatar Menu.
- Compact
  - Each Item uses 2 lines or less
  - Up/Down use Icons
  - "Remove" is called "Delete" (Less Letters, Compact)
 - Adding a new item duplicates the one at the end
   - Faster Menu Item Creation
